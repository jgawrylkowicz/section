# Section
Section is a simple theme for Hexo — static blog generator framework — that uses pug, sass and pjax for asynchronous loadings. This theme offers a much simplified version of the portfolio page I've been working on. The user interaction is based around sections which make the site easier to navigate, especially on mobile. 

## TO-DO

### Performance
* Work out the performance issues on some platforms (especially on Firefox)
* Compress and minimize the files, reduce the overall weight of the theme
* Add handling events for mobile browsers (ontouch, ontap)
* Compress the class names
* Lazy loading for images
* Loading images based on the client's display size and resolution

### UI / UX
* Add more customization options in the config file
* Simplify the article feed. The design of the posts need to be updated. 
* Asynchronous loading and a new way for displaying the articles (e.g. a dialogue window)


### Other
* Get a better score than https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/ - meaning fix all the issues
