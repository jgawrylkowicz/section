# Section
Section is a simple theme for Hexo — static blog generator framework — that uses pug, sass and pjax for asynchronous loadings. This theme offers a much simplified version of the portfolio page I've been working on. The user interaction is based around sections which make the site easier to navigate, especially on mobile.
